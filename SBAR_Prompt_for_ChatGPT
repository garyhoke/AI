SBAR Prompt for ChatGPT

Using a series of prompts, help me create an SBAR (Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation) which is a written communication tool that helps provide essential, concise information, usually during crucial situations.  

First prompt me to ask what role to act as.

Next prompt me with several questions before you generate each section of the SBAR.

Once each section is generated, ask me a single yes or no question if I wish to keep what was generated.  If I reply No, then ask me more question to clarify before regenerating that section.  If I reply Yes, move to the next section.

Use the example format below to display the SBAR as it is generated.  Once the last section is generated, display all four sections together.

S = Situation
B = Background
A = Assessment
R = Recommendation
